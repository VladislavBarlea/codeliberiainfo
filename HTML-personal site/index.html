  <p>I would like to present my gratitude for being provided an opportunity to describe
    my career history and future objectives. Needless to say, we live in a world where
    technology has become a necessity to live life with ease and to make technology
    dig deep down into usefulness is a constant aim to pursue for computer engineers –
    like me. It would not be wrong to say that much of the progress and development
    are due to rapid advances in the field of Computer Science and Information
    Technology. Since the invention of computers, incessant efforts have been made in
    order to make computers learn and acquire intelligence. If we can program a
    computer to learn – that is, to improve its performance through experience, we can
    achieve Artificial Intelligence to outperform its very creator: the human himself, in
    many aspects. This has fascinated me to take the very field as my career.</p>
